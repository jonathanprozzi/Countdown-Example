# Countdown-Project
This is a project template/basic example to be used for the capstone project. 

The main concept is to use a timer (or timers!) to create/modify/add elements or change styles on a page.

# Project Ideas:
If you're having trouble thinking of your own idea, here are some suggestions for inspiration.
* Remove or add page content once the timer hits a certain point.
* Track the timer by modifying elements. 
* Change the style of the page once the countdown hits a 0 (or have it count up!)
* Modify the color (or other style) of the page as the timer increments!
* Your own awesome idea!
